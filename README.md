# Usage

First, whem you run the app,you will see a main menu when you can select the option you want, here I will explain how to use every avaliable option:

### Tasks

In this sub menu you will have for options.

1. Add task.

You just simply have to add the requested information, in this case, the name of your task, then, the description and finally the date. **Important** you have to enter the date in your computer's date format and you can add the hour that you want, default is 00:00:00.

2. Delete all tasks.

This is a dangerous option, this will delete the whole file where your tasks are being stored. If you do it, please exit the app and run it again to avoid errors.

3. Show all Task.

Just shows all the current tasks that you have in the .txt file including all its information.

##### This is how the task sub-menu looks like.

Pomodoro is easy to use, just enter the minutes that you want and that's all. After the minutes are up, automatically a 5 minutes break will start and then you can decide if you want to stop or continue.
